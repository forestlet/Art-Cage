		<h1>Welcome to the wonderful cage of art</h1>
		<p>
			Animals are the closest living things to human beings. The evolution of our interactions with nonhuman
			animals is a natural outgrowth of our own social dynamics and an expression of our highest ideals. The
			evolution of zoos is the best example of how power dynamics have shifted over the course of human history.
			When a human and an animal look at each other, they are, in effect, staring into a mirror.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are now entering a room as if we were animals. There are many artworks here, and you can stay as long as
			you want, but you can't leave.
